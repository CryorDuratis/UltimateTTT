# rules of the game
1. you can click in any box with a red outline
2. which square you click in the small grid determines which square in the big grid the next player will be sent to. They can only play a move in that box
3. if 3 in a row is achieved by either player in big square, they win that big square and claim it
4. players can continue to play inside the claimed squares until they are full, but the winner of that square will not change
5. if a player is directed into a big square that has already been claimed, they are free to choose any big square to click in
6. the first player to claim 3 big squares in a row wins in UltimateTTT

this code was created to streamline the rules and keep track of claimed grids but convenient playing
